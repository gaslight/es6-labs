> What the hell is this?

Simply put it's a place where you code in ES6 which gets converted to ES5 on the fly along with jasmine test.

ES6 => ECMAScript6

> How to setup your ES6 LAB?

* git clone https://github.com/hemanth/es6-lab-setup.git

* cd es6-lab-setup

* npm install 

* gulp

That would watch for any changes in `js` and `spec` dir and fire a `6to5` or `traceur` and `jasmine` task.

P.S: You may use `gulp 6to5` or `gulp traceur` as per your need, defaults to `6to5`.
